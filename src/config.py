FEATURES = [
    # Bank client data
    "age",  # age (numeric)
    "job",  # type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
    "marital",  # marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
    "education",  # education (categorical: 'basic.4y',' basic.6y',' basic.9y', 'high.school', 'illiterate', 'professional.course', 'university.degree', 'unknown')
    "default",  # has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
    "housing",  # has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
    "loan",  # has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown') -- related with the last contact of the current campaign
    "contact",  # contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')

    "day_of_week",  # last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
    # "duration",  # last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

    "pdays",  # number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
